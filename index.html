                        <p class="skills__text">To begin, it is difficult to define Project Management in a single term. Each of us will have different responses to the question, implying that this will have varied consequences on us by resulting in distinct implications. Those who are unfamiliar with project management will have challenges in learning it in the smallest amount of time; that is, learning it overnight is not a piece of cake. Even if you know nothing, there is a potential that incremental learning may result in good changes in the individual, who may then utilize this information for their own goals in the future. For me, when we were initially exposed to Project Management Course this year, we thought it would be simple to be equipped with it in a month, but that wasn't the case for all of us. We have been going through many subjects regarding were unheard of all the time from the beginning of the course, but that has allowed us to see that Project Management Course plays an important part in all sectors of life. Day after day, concepts that were earlier regarded to be simple to understand became considerably more difficult for which we were unprepared. Overall, I felt Project Management had nothing for me other than projects that we had to present on time, about which I had strong opinions until I realized that wasn't true at all. To be honest, we have completed so many projects that have taught us the fundamentals of this course that I have no complaints that we pushed further into the course by looking for new topics that may have picked our interest in the first place. As I previously stated, we came from diverse backgrounds for the course, which means that we each have our own approach to the course. If I had the opportunity to illustrate how illusive it is to define the entire course, I would like to do so in one long text, not in one word?! <br>
                        Actually, we can today say that project management is all about knowing exactly what your goals are, how you intend to reach them, what resources you will need, and how long it will take you to achieve that specific goal. By analyzing the course, we noticed that all of these transitioned from conventional tools such as pen and paper to the use of sophisticated technologies in the present period of time, which includes customizable tools to speed up and easy the complete project management task. In terms of relevance, we can state that the evolution of a project would be chaotic without the concept of project management. Furthermore, we discovered that project management is primarily concerned with planning and organizing a project and its resources by identifying and managing the lifecycle to be used, applying it to the user-centered design process, forming the project team, and efficiently guiding the team through all phases until project completion. When we consider its worth to project development, we can see that by adopting project management, we may prevent hazards and use our own available resources effectively and efficiently. In addition, we separated project management into nine sections during the course, which included integration management, scope management, time management, cost management, quality management, human resource management, communication management, risk management, and procurement management. Furthermore, Project Management assisted us in forming and working in teams, with each member assigned various duties, and we now have a better knowledge of planned/regular meetings, their formality, course of presentation, documentation, workflow, and team approval. <br>
                        To summarize, project management is about clear, planned plans that promote team cooperation, clarifying everyone's job to minimize misunderstanding, well-defined goals that improve team effectiveness, and a specified communication strategy that keeps the team aligned and helps to boost efficiency.

                        <p>Hundreds of millions of people throughout the world lack appropriate access to one of life's most basic necessities: clean water. Despite the fact that governments and humanitarian organizations have assisted many people living in water-stressed areas acquire access in recent years, the situation is expected to worsen due to the detrimental consequences of improper water usage and the unpredictability of agricultural water consumption.
                        Water stress varies greatly from place to location, and in some situations, it can have far-reaching consequences for public health, economic growth, and global trade. Pressure is rising on governments to adopt more sustainable and creative methods, as well as to increase international water management cooperation.
                        Therefore, project will place more emphasis on water loss and waste consumption of it across the country.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Project will cover all water resources of the country as it is aimed at monitoring water rates used per entity in the country. That is, the device that has specific characteristics will control water used by making state changes of water much quicker, collecting changes of water pressure, temperature, volume and its speed that in turn might change people mindset to using water properly and then, rediscover its reusability at other levels. Itself, the device might bring changes to the restaurants as there are always an excess use of water meaning that it is becoming uncontrollable in some ways. As water is connected to all areas, after that it might turn into huge project that might even alleviate the excess levels of water use in agriculture spheres. However, even small problems such as in the case of restaurants may resolve profound issues by stepping towards the future slowly, but confidently with the kind of such technologies.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This project will lead to a production of a new type of tapes used in the houses that will control water levels used, temperature, pressure, volume, state changes and contamination levels. In some cases, it might work as a filter in order to reduce water contamination. Water level and volume control will enable to collect the data about the water leaking through the tap that in turn might be a key to strict requirement policies. Moreover, control over quick transitional change of water state will take it milliseconds to change the water from hot state to cold and vice versa stating that it will decrease the amount of water lost unnecessarily. In addition, volume control of the water implies that it needs to be controlled how much water is used per entity across each house. All the automatic system integrated into one tap also controls how fast water is leaking through tap while showing to the potential users how they can change temperature levels on their own by checking all these rates each time. In the future, these taps can contain in themselves such filters that ensure both contamination and reusability of water control as a new development for the project.
